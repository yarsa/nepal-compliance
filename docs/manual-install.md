For detailed pre-requisites and installation, refer to the [Frappeâ€™s official documentation](https://docs.frappe.io/framework/user/en/installation).

Nepal Compliance app is built on top of ERPNext and HRMS. Ensure that both are installed and running before installing or using this app.

**Ensure you are inside a working bench directory with `bench find .`**

First, start bench server:
```
bench start
```
Keep the bench server running in the first terminal and open a second terminal to run commands ahead.

## Step 1: Install ERPNext
First, Get ERPNext from Frappe's App Registry

```
bench get-app erpnext
```

Second, Install ERPNext on your site:

```
bench --site your_site_name install-app erpnext
```

## Step 2: Install HRMS
First, Get HRMS from Frappe's App Registry

```
bench get-app hrms
```

Second, Install HRMS on your site:

```
bench --site your_site_name install-app hrms
```

## Step 3: Install Nepal Compliance
First, Get the Nepal Compliance app:

```
bench get-app https://github.com/yarsa/nepal-compliance.git
```

Install Nepal Compliance on your site:

```
bench --site your_site_name install-app nepal_compliance
```

**To verify the installation,**
```
bench --site your_site_name list-apps
```
You should see `nepal_compliance` listed as installed apps on your site.

### Access your ERP instance running at `http://localhost:8000`

In cases of no visible changes, run bench migrations on the site to apply changes.
```
bench --site your_site_name migrate
```
