# Install Nepal Compliance using Docker
**This guide will help you install and run Nepal Compliance using Docker and Docker Compose.**

### Dependencies
You need to have the Docker installed and ready in your system:
* Docker Engine & Docker CLI. Check using `docker --version`
* Docker Compose. Check using `docker compose version`

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the Nepal Compliance repository from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/yarsa/nepal-compliance.git
```
Change directory into the folder:
```
cd nepal-compliance
```

## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` to `.env`

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your own values. For eg:

```
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-admin-password
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=your-db-root-password
```
***Note: The `.env` file should be placed at the root of the project directory next to your `compose.yaml` file.***


## Step 3: Pull the Docker Image
### Pull the default `latest` tag from DockerHub
```
docker pull yarsalabs/nepal-compliance
```
**Or**, specify a VERSION_TAG. For example, to pull v0.1.0:
```
docker pull yarsalabs/nepal-compliance:v0.1.0
```

For arm64 based macOS, edit first line of `.env` file and set `VERSION_TAG=latest`.

For amd64 based Windows and Ubuntu, set `VERSION_TAG=v0.1.0`.

## Step 4: Run Nepal Compliance with Docker Compose

```
docker compose up -d
```

### Access your ERP instance running at `http://localhost:8080`

Now you should have Nepal Compliance up and running using Docker.

After docker compose, the `create-site-1` container runs in background and takes around 3-5 minutes to install and build frappe apps along with `frontend` site, so check logs before accessing it in your browser.
```
docker logs {container-name} -f
```

Also after setting up the `.env` file, you can check variables and values used by your Compose to interpolate the Compose model by running:
```
docker compose config --environment
```
This command should display all environment variables in `.env` being used in your Docker Compose.
